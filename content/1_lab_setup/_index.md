Welcome to the Event Engine Setup section! This means that you are attending an AWS Hosted Workshop!! . Event Engine is a tool created at AWS that provisions AWS accounts for workshop events like this! These accounts will automatically terminate 24 hours after the workshop begins participants don't have to worry about leaving anything on. Each workshop participant will receive their own Event Engine AWS account. 

## What We Will Do

* Get a temporary AWS account using the AWS Event Engine.
* Access your AWS Console
* Get your Lacework access email
* Access the Lacework instance

The next page will show you how to gain access to your Event Engine dashboard!
