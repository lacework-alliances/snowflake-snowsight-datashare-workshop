      <description>We are now ready to deploy your image with Amazon ECS. If not yet created, Amazon ECS can create a new VPC and ECS cluster as well as the other components that are required to serve your application. Amazon ECS will then authenticate, pull the image from Artifactory and deploy the container to the ECS cluster.
The Amazon ECS first-run wizard guides you through the process of getting started with Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type.</description>
