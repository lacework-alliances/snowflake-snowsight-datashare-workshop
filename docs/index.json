	"content": " Build Your Own Cloud Security Data Lake with Snowflake and Lacework Welcome In this workshop, get a hands-on demonstration of how to analyze your Lacework Cloud Security data with Snowflake Snowsight to extract additional insights. Using Snowsight you will build your own dashboards that provide real-time visibility into your multi-cloud security posture. Develop and explore visualizations of your software vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and security threats. Additionally, you will learn how to correlate Lacework security events with your application and infrastructure monitoring.\nLearning Objectives  Understand how Lacework monitors your cloud security posture. Learn how to use Snowsight to query Lacework security data and build custom dashboards. Understand how to correlate Lacework security data with your application and infrastructure monitoring data to identify security-related performance issues.  The examples and sample code provided in this session are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.\n Thanks for joining this session and let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\n"

You can filter from the last 24 hours to 90 days (or 180 days if you have subscribed for additional storage). Click Trends to switch the view to display Events over Time, a graph displaying events of varying severity (from critical to informational) over the same selected timeframe.  Filter events by severity, under Events Over Time, select one or more checkboxes. The slider bars underneath the graph allow you to zoom in to a smaller time period during the selected timeframe, for example, you can adjust both left and right sliders during a 3-day window to view a 4-hour window.\n  Observe the Compliance Trends Over Time graph are two bar graphs that display CloudTrail and host events. The CloudTrail graph is populated with events only if a Lacework AWS integration is configured and the host graph is populated only if agents are deployed in your environment. By default, the graph displays up to five event types. The listed order of the event types is weighted by the severity of the events followed by the total number of events, for example, one critical event is listed before two high severity events. If more than 5 event types are available for the selected time period, you can view the remaining event types by clicking the View \u0026hellip; link below the graph.\n  Observe the Cloud Compliance Events and Host Events panels to see the breakdown of events.   The Global Dashboard provides a quick view of your cloud security posture. It gives you a summary of your security data, trends and events.\n"

The Resource Inventory page allows you to view and monitor in-use AWS resources’ risk, compliance, and configuration changes and provides visibility for team members with limited or no access to the AWS Management Console. Because Lacework takes regular snapshots of your resources, you can track their changes (diffs) through the Lacework Console.\n Go to Resources \u0026gt; Cloud \u0026gt; AWS CloudTrail in the Lacework Console. Lacework analyzes the use and API activity from AWS CloudTrail logs.  View the Timeline panel on the right to observe anomalous events detected from the CloudTrail activity.  Scroll down to the Polygraph panel. Lacework\u0026rsquo;s Patented Polygraph feature graphs your user and API activity and enables you to see the sequence of behaviors. Additionally, anomalous behavior is flagged and highlighted as RED.  Use the Search field to filter the Polygraph on services, resources API calls, accounts, users and responses. Use the DIFF button on the right to compare the current Polygraph snapshot to the previous (1 hour). This helps you understand the changes that have occurred.  Go to Resources \u0026gt; Cloud \u0026gt; Inventory. The Resource Inventory page allows you to view and monitor in-use AWS resources’ risk, compliance, and configuration changes.

Lacework provides a set of predefined default policies that are visible from the Lacework Console. You can use the default policies to suppress the generation of unwanted alerts in your environment. Default policy IDs start with the LW_ prefix. You may want to create custom policies that check for unwanted behavior in your environment such as Telnet being used in your environment. You can also customize the triggers and severities for custom policies. Custom policy IDs start with the CUSTOM_ prefix.\n Go to Policies in the Lacework Console. The Policies page displays all policies. It provides a summary and list of all of your default and custom policies. You can use the following methods to refine the list of displayed policies:  Use filters to display a subset of specific policies. Click filters along the top of the page to display only the desired policies. Or click the filter icon and select the filters you want to display.  Use the search function at the top of the page to find specific text in the policy name or ID. When the page displays your desired policies after filtering, you can save the current view by clicking the Save view icon in the top right corner. This allows you to access the saved view later through the Open view icon.\n  Scroll through the list of policies. You can disable or enable each policy directly from the policies list. Mousing over a policy displays icons for any available actions such as clone or delete. You can also click a policy to clone it (create a custom policy) or edit a custom policy\u0026rsquo;s queries and parameters. Click a policy to display its details. The Summary tab lists details of the policy.  Click on the Query detail to view the policy query that is used for validation.  To create a custom policy, clone an existing policy first. Update the name, summary details and query. For custom policy queries, Lacework allows simple comparison expressions that are created in the console. Learn more about the types of expressions that you can use here.\n   Lacework default policies enable out-of-the-box security validation of your AWS environments. But not every organization is the same and custom policies are a great way to add validation specific to your organization\u0026rsquo;s requirements.\n"
