      <description>The Lacework Console provides visibility into AWS resources that are integrated with Lacework. A resource can be any entity within the cloud deployment, such as an S3 bucket, security group, or EC2 instance. The Resource Inventory page allows you to view and monitor in-use AWS resources’ risk, compliance, and configuration changes and provides visibility for team members with limited or no access to the AWS Management Console. Because Lacework takes regular snapshots of your resources, you can track their changes (diffs) through the Lacework Console.</description>

      <description>Lacework policies provide a framework for validating configuration and behavior in your cloud environment. Lacework provides a set of predefined default policies that are visible from the Lacework Console. You can use the default policies to suppress the generation of unwanted alerts in your environment. Default policy IDs start with the LW_ prefix. You may want to create custom policies that check for unwanted behavior in your environment such as Telnet being used in your environment.</description>

      <description>Lacework combines alert channels and alert rules to provide a flexible method for routing alerts. For alert channels (outgoing integrations), you define information about where to send alerts, such as to Jira or Slack. For alert rules, you define information about which alert types to send, such as critical and high severity compliance alerts. This two-part method provides the flexibility to define multiple channels and multiple rules and then have each rule use the channels you specify.</description>
